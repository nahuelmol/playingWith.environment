Here I have a problem with filesystem's header system management, then I have decide to add a .hpp file to my include folder. Thanks for https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem

* It must be executed `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"` in cmd or promt for setting mingw as generator
* I have added few .dll libraries for execute `make .` correctly in my system
